# Tabletop
This web application is an exciting fan project created by a small, dedicated team in Germany. Inspired by classic tabletop games and the endless possibilities offered by LEGO, we have developed a fascinating concept for playing with it. Our tabletop is based on the official Lego Star Wars products and allows you to play with them in a complex set of rules. This innovative application perfectly complements the game and encompasses all the rules and mechanics necessary for an optimal gaming experience.

This application is a true enhancement for every player who wants to fully enjoy the game. It provides an intuitive user interface that allows players of all experience levels to seamlessly immerse themselves and focus on what matters mostâ€”the gameplay itself. The team has worked hard to create a platform that excites players by giving them full control over their gaming experience while also providing the ability to document their progress and achievements.
