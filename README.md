# Tabletop
Tablebricks is a passionate fan project that we, a small team from Germany, have been developing with dedication since 2019. Inspired by classic tabletop games and the limitless building possibilities that LEGO offers, we have created a unique concept for LEGO® Star Wars. Our goal is to provide a gaming experience that is both accessible and boundless. With minimal effort, you can start playing right away, while also having the opportunity to engage in epic battles with massive armies on impressive landscapes. Tablebricks brings your minifigures to life and lets them compete in exciting game modes.

Our team has worked hard to create a platform that makes Tablebricks accessible and offers players an exciting new experience. On our website, you can share your statistics and use our tools to make your gameplay smarter. We emphasize that the digital component is designed to enhance the gaming experience. For example, in the Army Designer, you can create templates for your next game or use the simulation mode to optimize your moves. However, we place great importance on ensuring that you are not dependent on digital support. Tablebricks can also be played entirely analog, offering a flexible gaming experience for all preferences. Discover how Tablebricks elevates your LEGO® Star Wars adventures to a new level and learn more on our website.
